# PHP Form Submission

This is a simple PHP script that demonstrates form submission and displays the submitted data.

## Usage

1. Place the PHP file (`index.php`) in your web server's document root directory.
2. Make sure you have PHP installed and configured on your server.
3. Access the script through your web browser by navigating to `http://localhost/index.php` (replace `localhost` with the appropriate server hostname if needed).
4. Fill in the input field with a username and click the "Submit" button.
5. The script will display a message with the submitted username.

## Customization

- To customize the appearance of the form, you can modify the CSS styles in the `<style>` section of the PHP file (`index.php`).
- You can change the text displayed after form submission by modifying the `echo` statement in the `<h1>` tag.
